## Battle Ship
  
This is a simple implementation of the game Battle Ship.
The computer will randomically choose the size of the board, and where to place the 11 ships over this board ( ./battleship.py ).
  
**Details:**  
Ship A - size 6  
Ship B - size 4  
Ship C - size 4  
Ship D - size 3  
Ship E - size 3  
Ship F - size 3  
Ship G - size 2  
Ship H - size 2  
Ship I - size 2  
  
I used the site bellow as reference for some ideas:

~~I still have a challenge, that is to work with small board, where the game will need to know which ships could be placed on the board.~~  
Now supporting small boards, where the script is totally able to place so many boats as possible ( ./battleship_small_boards.py )  
  
Anders, thanks for the challenge.
